      A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or café is an establishment that primarily
      serves coffee of various types, e.g. espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
      Some coffeehouses may serve cold drinks, such as iced coffee, iced tea,
      and other non-caffeinated beverages. In continental Europe, cafés serve
      alcoholic drinks. A coffeehouse may also serve food, such as light
      snacks, sandwiches, muffins, fruit, or pastries. Coffeehouses range from
      owner-operated small businesses to large multinational corporations.
      Some coffeehouse chains operate on a franchise business model, with
      numerous branches across various countries around the world.
